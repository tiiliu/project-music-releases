# Music Releases

This week we started working with React. We created components by using data from Spotify to show new album and single releases. The project was done by pair-programming with @Mimmisen.

## The problem

We started the project by planning the layout and structure of components on Figma. Then we created the components for different sections and used map() function to render the data to all the elements when mounting them.
With more time we would create additional components to show more data.
